# AGENTS.md

Guidance for AI coding agents working in this repository.

## Project overview

Crypto Research Terminal is an npm-workspaces monorepo built with TypeScript and Node.js 22 or newer. It has three workspaces:

- `apps/web`: Next.js 16 App Router UI using React 19, TanStack Query, TanStack Table, and Lightweight Charts.
- `apps/api`: Express 5 API using Better Auth, Prisma, PostgreSQL, Redis, and CoinGecko.
- `packages/contracts`: shared Zod schemas and inferred TypeScript types used at both application boundaries.

The browser must call the Express API rather than CoinGecko directly. Public market research is available to guests; all persistent workspace features require an authenticated account.

## Repository map

- `apps/web/app`: routes, layouts, route-level loading, and global styles.
- `apps/web/components`: interactive client components and feature UI.
- `apps/web/lib/api.ts`: typed HTTP client and workspace API operations.
- `apps/web/lib/auth-client.ts`: centralized Better Auth browser client.
- `apps/web/lib/theme.ts`: the only intentional application use of `localStorage`.
- `apps/web/e2e`: Playwright desktop, mobile, and accessibility journeys.
- `apps/api/src/app.ts`: Express application composition and public capability endpoints.
- `apps/api/src/market-routes.ts`: public market and research endpoints.
- `apps/api/src/workspace-routes.ts`: authenticated, user-owned persistence endpoints.
- `apps/api/src/auth.ts`: Better Auth configuration.
- `apps/api/src/coingecko.ts`: upstream CoinGecko client.
- `apps/api/src/cache.ts`: Redis cache with an in-memory fallback.
- `apps/api/prisma/schema.prisma`: authentication and workspace data model.
- `packages/contracts/src/index.ts`: shared public API contracts.

## Required workflow

1. Read the nearest `AGENTS.md` before editing. `apps/web/AGENTS.md` contains generated Next.js-version guidance that also applies inside the web workspace.
2. Inspect the relevant implementation and tests before changing behavior.
3. Preserve unrelated working-tree changes; do not reset or rewrite user work.
4. Update shared Zod contracts before or alongside API response changes, then update both consumers and tests.
5. Run the narrowest relevant checks while iterating and the full appropriate checks before handoff.
6. After any large or cross-cutting code change, always run `npm run lint` and `npm run build` from the repository root and resolve any failures before handoff.

## Commands

Run commands from the repository root unless a command explicitly targets a workspace.

```bash
npm install                    # install all workspace dependencies
npm run dev                    # run API on :4000 and web on :3000
npm run typecheck              # type-check contracts, API, and web
npm run lint                   # lint API and web
npm test                       # run API and web Vitest suites
npm run build                  # production build for all workspaces
npm run format:check           # check formatting
npm run db:generate            # regenerate the Prisma client
npm run db:migrate             # create/apply a local Prisma migration
npm run test:e2e -w @crypto-terminal/web
```

For focused checks, use npm's workspace flag, for example:

```bash
npm run test -w @crypto-terminal/api
npm run typecheck -w @crypto-terminal/web
```

The contracts workspace must be built before downstream workspaces consume newly changed contracts. The root scripts already enforce that ordering where needed.

## Environment and generated files

- Copy `.env.example` to the repository-root `.env` for local development.
- Both applications deliberately load the root `.env`; do not create competing workspace environment files.
- Never commit `.env`, credentials, session data, or provider secrets.
- Authentication capabilities are conditional:
  - Google requires `DATABASE_URL`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`.
  - Email/password requires `DATABASE_URL`, `RESEND_API_KEY`, and `AUTH_EMAIL_FROM`.
  - Production authentication also requires an explicit `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`.
- PostgreSQL is the source of truth for accounts and workspace data. Redis is only a cache.
- Do not commit `.next`, `dist`, coverage, Playwright reports, logs, or generated Prisma client output.
- When the Prisma schema changes, add a migration and run `npm run db:generate`.

## Architecture invariants

### API and contracts

- Validate external input and public responses with Zod; shared request/response shapes belong in `packages/contracts`.
- Keep upstream CoinGecko details behind `apps/api`; normalize provider errors instead of leaking raw responses.
- Preserve request timeouts, rate limiting, cache behavior, request IDs, and structured error handling when extending routes.
- Use `ApiException` for intentional HTTP errors.
- Every workspace route must authenticate the session and scope all reads and mutations to the current user. UI locks are not authorization.
- Primary-watchlist operations must remain race-safe and must not require the client to know a generated watchlist ID.

### Authentication and persistence

- Better Auth is mounted on the Express API and uses secure HTTP-only cookies; never store tokens or sessions in browser storage.
- Preserve validated relative `returnTo` redirects. Never allow an external URL as an authentication callback.
- Email/password accounts require email verification. Keep password reset and verification responses privacy-preserving.
- Google is the only social provider unless the product requirements explicitly change.
- Guests may browse markets, comparisons, and coin research but may not read, edit, or persist watchlists, saved screens, or research notes.
- Do not reintroduce guest workspace storage, guest-to-account merging, recently viewed persistence, or workspace data in `localStorage`.
- `cryptoTerminal.theme` is the only intentional application `localStorage` value; preserve the pre-hydration theme script.

### Web application

- Use Server Components by default and add `"use client"` only where browser state, effects, or event handlers require it.
- Use the centralized auth provider/client and `apps/web/lib/api.ts`; do not create feature-local session clients or ad hoc fetch layers.
- Use TanStack Query for authenticated server state, with optimistic updates only when rollback is safe and explicit.
- Do not request workspace data until the session is confirmed authenticated. On sign-out, immediately restore locked guest states.
- Keep locked controls visible and route them through the reusable accessible auth prompt.
- Maintain keyboard navigation, focus restoration, reduced-motion behavior, semantic tables/forms, and accessible chart data summaries.

## Testing expectations

- Add or update tests whenever behavior, contracts, authorization, redirect validation, persistence, or formatting logic changes.
- API tests use Vitest and Supertest and live next to source files as `*.test.ts`.
- Web unit tests use Vitest and Testing Library; end-to-end and accessibility coverage uses Playwright.
- Authentication or workspace changes must cover guest `401` responses and cross-user ownership boundaries.
- UI locking changes must cover guests, authenticated users, sign-out transitions, keyboard behavior, and return links.
- Before handing off a broad change, run `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, `npm test`, and `npm run build`. Run Playwright when a browser-visible journey changed.

## Git commits

- Follow [Conventional Commits 1.0.0](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) using `<type>[optional scope]: <description>`.
- Keep commits focused; use types such as `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `test`, `refactor`, `build`, `ci`, and `chore` according to intent.
- Mark breaking changes with `!` or a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer.
- Do not add AI tools or assistants as authors, co-authors, sign-offs, or commit-message attribution unless the user explicitly requests it.
